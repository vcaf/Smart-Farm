# Smart-Farm

## Description
Mobile app for monitoring a crop, where the user can monitor their crops with a air sensor (humidity and temperature), soil sensor (moisture level), gas emission sensor and wind sensor (direction and speed of the wind).
This way we can give farmers insight and control into their crops with this information.

Further, this project was conducted with three other students, where each student worked on a sensor. 
The sensor I worked on was the air sensor where the focus is in this read me file.

##### Disclaimer
The air module page has no data of the sensor due to the reason that the sensor is not functioning anymore.
